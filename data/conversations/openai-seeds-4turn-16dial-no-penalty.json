It's an incredibly common problem and there are a few things you can do to make sure your resume stands out and boost your confidence. First, make sure that your resume reflects your experience and skillset relevant to the job you're applying for. Employers get hundreds of resumes for each opening and it's important that yours stands out. Additionally, make sure you have a solid understanding of the job description and tailor your resume to each one. For example, if the job requires customer service experience, make sure you highlight that experience with key accomplishments. Lastly, take the time to review your resume and proofread it to ensure it is error free. Connecting with people who have had success in the same field as yours is also a great way to get some advice.\n\nGood luck with your job search!"

Whether it's learning a new skill, attending conferences, or joining a professional organization, find ways to demonstrate to employers that you are proactive and committed. \n\u2022Focus on what you can control. You can't control how many other people are also applying for the same job, or what the hiring company looks for; you can only control your own effort and attitude towards the process. \n\u2022Create a routine. Try to stay organized and focused on your job search. Develop a schedule and stick to it, so you can track your progress and keep your motivation up. \n\u2022Choose the right job boards. Networking is extremely important, so make sure to use job boards that align with your niche. Additionally, use job search platforms specifically designed to help you reach the employers you want to apply for. \n\u2022Don't forget to take time for yourself. Job search can be an emotionally and mentally draining process. Make sure to make room for physical activity, relaxation and time for yourself; it will help you to stay energized and motivated. \n\nI hope these tips"

For much of my life, I've been dealing with feelings of sadness and an inability to connect with others. I think some of this may have been triggered by my father leaving when I was young. I've had trouble in romantic relationships, and have been married and divorced twice. I also have two teenage daughters and joint custody. I had a period of time where I struggled with alcohol use disorder, although I'm happy to report I'm no longer engaging in that behavior. I'm looking for a way to manage my depression so that I can feel more connected to others and to myself."

Secondly, making connections with other people who understand and share your experiences can promote a sense of belonging and support. Consider finding a support group, a mentor, or even simple conversations with people who have had similar experiences to you. Finally, finding ways to practice self-care is essential to managing the stress of this transition. This could include exercise, hobbies, and other activities that bring you joy. Good luck!"
