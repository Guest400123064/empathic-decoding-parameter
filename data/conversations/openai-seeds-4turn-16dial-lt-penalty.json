Have you taken the time to map out your expectations and plan out a timeline to break down each goal into smaller, achievable tasks? One of the hardest parts of becoming successful is often setting a realistic plan and following through on it. Additionally, self-care is essential to lasting success: make sure you are taking time to rest and recharge in between your work tasks. This could involve exercise, talk therapy, or doing things that bring you joy.  Lastly, remember that this is a process - progress and success don't happen overnight - so be sure to recognize and appreciate the small wins along the way."

Retirement can be a difficult transition for many people. It's understandable to face feelings of uncertainty and need help releasing the identity of your previous career life. \n\nOne way that you can start to think about finding purpose and fulfillment is to focus on what brings you joy and what matters most to you. What activities do you find enjoyable? What do you want to do with your free time? What were the most meaningful moments of your previous career? How can you build upon these experiences in a post-working life? \n\nIt may also help to explore what values you want to focus on at this stage of life, such as relationships, giving back to the community, or exploring hobbies. These values can provide a meaningful framework for your days and ultimately give you a sense of purpose.

One of the most important things to do is to take the time to figure out what it is that is important to you. What are your interests, your goals, and your values? Ask yourself\u2013what drives and motivates you? Some people find purpose in spending more time with family or volunteering in their community. Others may find it in challenges like learning a new skill or taking on a project. Whatever it is, it needs to be something that is meaningful to you, and something that you feel excited and passionate about. Once you've figured out what it is that truly speaks to you, break it down into smaller, achievable goals, and create a practical action plan for how to move forward.\u201d"

It sounds like you are struggling to cope with changes in your life, and it's important to understand that these changes are normal for a teen like you. To help you work through your current challenges, I suggest looking into cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). CBT can help you gain an understanding of your thoughts and behavior, and figure out ways to approach your emotions more effectively. Additionally, practicing relaxation techniques such as mindfulness and meditation may help you find balance and better manage your feelings. Finally, engaging in positive activities such as exercising and talking to supportive friends will also help you develop a healthier outlook on life."
