It's understandable to feel this way, especially when you're trying to find a job after graduating from a top program. It's important to remember that you have the skills and knowledge to be successful in your job search. To help you feel more confident and optimistic, I suggest focusing on the things you can control. Start by creating a plan of action and setting achievable goals.

Lastly, don't forget to reach out to your network for support and advice. I hope this helps!"

You can also count your breaths to help you stay focused. For progressive muscle relaxation, you can start by tensing and relaxing each muscle group in your body, starting with your feet and working your way up to your head. This can help you to relax your body and mind. I hope this helps!"
